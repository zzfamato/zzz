# Fake news!
***
Detect Fake news with BERT.
## Dataset overview

Dataset:
The training dataset has over 20,000 articles with fields for the article title, author, and text. The label field is the outcome variable where a 1 indicates the article is unreliable and a 0 indicates the article is reliable. The testing dataset consists of over 5000 unlabeled articles. The corresponding labels for those articles can be found in labels.csv. 

* train.csv contains 20800 articles where the ratio between positive and negative is balanced.
* test.csv contains 5200 articles
* labels.csv

Deliverables:
We would like you to build a pipeline for predicting the reliability of the articles in the dataset using any machine learning method of your choice (you are not constrained to a deep learning approach). Please do not submit an IPython Notebook or other interactable environment. Instead, submit a folder containing your .py file(s). 
While producing a good result on the test data is ideal, the performance is not the main focus of this assignment. We are interested in your code quality, and your design process. We would like you to justify the design decisions you made such as:

The overall approach
The preprocessing steps
Evaluation procedure and metrics
Aspects that could be improved
etc.

These justifications can be made either with code comments, or in a README file. 
	To be mindful of your time, this project should not take more than 2-3 hours to complete. Use this as a benchmark to gauge the depth/detail required in your solution.

Submission:
	To submit your assignment, please reply to this email with either a GitHub, GitLab, or Google Drive link to your code.



If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

Good luck!
